## ðŸš€ MCP Learning Project: Understanding Model Context Protocol
## ðŸŒŸ Overview
Welcome to the MCP Learning Project! This repository serves as a hands-on guide to understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our goal is to demystify how model contextâ€”crucial metadata, environmental details, and usage instructionsâ€”can be systematically defined, stored, and consumed.

In this project, we've created a simple "Hello World" machine learning model (a basic doubler function) and built a custom MCP specification around it. You'll see how a structured context file can provide all the necessary information for a hypothetical system to understand and interact with a model, without needing to inspect its internal code directly.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
Okay, you've got the project setup; now let's create a README.md that effectively explains your "MCP Learning Project." A great README isn't just documentation; it's the front door to your project, making it easy for anyone (including your future self!) to understand, run, and contribute.

Here's a comprehensive README template, tailored to your "MCP to learn about MCP" project, with explanations for each section.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
The "Model Context Protocol" (MCP) isn't a single, universally defined standard (like HTTP). Instead, in the context of this project, it represents a structured approach to encapsulating all the necessary information for a computational model (e.g., an ML model, simulation, data pipeline) to be correctly understood, replicated, and executed.

Think of it as a comprehensive "ID card" or "manifest" for your model, detailing:

## Project Structure
What it is: Name, version, type.
How to run it: Entry points, dependencies, runtime environment.
What it expects/produces: Input/output schemas.
Where it came from: Author, creation date, provenance.
This project implements a simple, illustrative MCP schema using JSON to demonstrate these concepts.

simple_model.py: Our very basic "machine learning model" (a function that doubles a number) which the MCP describes.
mcp_context.json: The core of this project â€“ our custom Model Context Protocol definition for simple_model.py.
read_mcp.py: A Python script that demonstrates how to load, validate, and interpret the information provided in mcp_context.json. It simulates how an external system might use the MCP to understand and interact with the model.
